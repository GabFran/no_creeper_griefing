# No Mob Griefing

This is a fork of hallettj's No Creeper Griefing: https://github.com/hallettj/no_creeper_griefing/ 

This fork includes other mob griefing events near players, such as Wither Skulls, Ghast Fireballs and Blaze Fireballs on top of Creeper Explosions.

**This datapack will override your `/gamerule mobGriefing` commands**. If you
want to disable `mobGriefing` permanently you will need to disable this
datapack.

**Servers only: This datapack is NOT compatible with servers that split world folders, such as paper**. The datapack might work in the main dimension (world folder), but not other dimensions.

(Thank you hallettj for providing a readable base code)
